This sketch illuminates the RGB LED of the Qwiic Twist and changes its color as you twist the knob while displaying the name of the color on the Micro OLED display.

Instructions:

You may need something to support your Qwiic breakout boards as you connect your hardware with Qwiic cables. I hacked together a little prototyping station using an old Arduino and Breadboard Holder from my SIK, some nylon standoff hardware, and some scrap particle board. Another solution is using 3M Dual Lock like Derek Runberg shows here. https://www.sparkfun.com/news/3277
1. If you haven’t already, solder some breakaway headers onto your Pro Micro so it can be held in place securely by the breadboard, and click it into place.
2. Secure the SparkFun Qwiic twist in place using a mounting hole and nylon standoff.
3. Connect the Qwiic Twist to the Pro Micro via a 200 mm Qwiic cable and the Qwiic JST connectors on the boards.
4. Secure the Micro OLED Dispay in place using a mounting hole and nylon standoff.
5. Connect the Micro OLED Display to the Qwiic Twist via a 200 mm Qwiic cable and the Qwiic JST connectors.
6. Plug in your USB C cable to the Pro Micro and connect it to your computer. Make sure you have the correct port and board selected under the tools menu. Also, make sure to select “ATMEGA 32U4 (5V, 16MHz)” under the “processor” option, or else you will get an upload error. Full setup for the pro micro here. https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-pro-micro-usb-c-atmega32u4-hookup-guide
7. Open the (sketch name here) sketch and hit upload.
8. If the sketch uploads successfully, you should see the SparkFun splash logo pop up, then the kob will turn red, and “RED” will be displayed on the Micro OLED. When you turn the knob either direction, the colors should change on the knob and OLED correspondingly.
